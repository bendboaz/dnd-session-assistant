.SYNOPSIS
  Prune finished agent branches + worktrees for the dnd-session-assistant agent loop.

.DESCRIPTION
  Idempotent and safe. Removes ONLY branches/worktrees whose PR is MERGED or CLOSED and
  that have NO open PR. It NEVER touches `main`, the currently checked-out branch, or any
  branch that still has an open PR -- so mid-flight work (a branch whose PR is still open,
  or a branch that has no PR yet) is always preserved.

  It keys off PR *state*, not git ancestry, so it works regardless of merge strategy
  (squash / rebase / merge commits all handled).

  Remote branches: this script prunes LOCAL worktrees + branches and stale remote-tracking
  refs (`fetch --prune`). Deleting the actual remote head branch on merge is best handled by
  the repo setting "Automatically delete head branches" (Settings -> General). See OPERATIONS.md.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Print what would be removed without changing anything. Always safe to run first.
